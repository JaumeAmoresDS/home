    "text": "Hello, and welcome to my home page! I currently work as a Principal Data Scientist in Johnson Controls. I have been working on Data Science for more than 20 years, in both academia and industry. I received a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computer vision in 2006, and have been in industry for more than 10 years, working both as individual contributor and technical lead in multi-disciplinary teams. I enjoy both the theoretical and practical aspects of Data Science, I like developing high quality software based on best practices, and have experience generating intellectual property.\nApart from my work, I am a dad of a little child and I am interested in early childhood education and health. I intend to write about those subjects in my blog posts, above."
