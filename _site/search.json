    "text": "Hello, and welcome to my home page! I work currently as a Principal Data Scientist in Johnson Controls. I have been working on Data Science for more than 20 years, in both academia and industry. I received a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computer vision in 2006, and have been in industry for more than 10 years, working both as individual contributor and technical lead in multi-disciplinary teams. I enjoy both the theoretical and practical aspects of Data Science, I like developing high quality software based on best practices, and have experience generating intellectual property. Please check my open source projects in the last section below.\nApart from my work, I am a dad of a little child and I am interested in early childhood education. I intend to write about my research on this subject in my blog posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPh.D. in Machine Learning and Computer Vision | Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona | 2006\nM.Sc. in Machine Learning and Computer Vision | Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona | 2003\nB.Sc. in Computer Science | Universitat de Valencia | 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment I only have published one open source library written in python with nbdev. I intend to publish more projects in the future.\n\nforecasting: link. This library intends to provide a uniform API around popular time-series forecasting solutions and libraries. At this moment, I have implemented a library based on LSTM auto-regressive models, using tensorflow’s dataset API. The next steps are to add baselines based on Random Forests, XGBoost, and ARIMA; and integrate libraries such as darts and tsai. Hopefully also gluonts."

A proxy for this is to achieve the maximum intensity while still being able to keep a conversation while doing the exercise.\nWe need to have a high-intensity exercise at least 10 minutes?
