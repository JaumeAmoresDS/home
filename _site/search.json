    "text": "Hello, and welcome to my home page! I currently work as a Principal Data Scientist in Johnson Controls. I have been working on Data Science for more than 20 years, in both academia and industry. I received a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computer vision in 2006, and have been in industry for more than 10 years, working both as individual contributor and technical lead in multi-disciplinary teams. I enjoy both the theoretical and practical aspects of Data Science, I like developing high quality software based on best practices, and have experience generating intellectual property.\nApart from my work, I am a dad of a little child and I am interested in early childhood education and health. I intend to write about those subjects in my blog posts, above."

This can be small things as:\n\nCommenting on interesting reads.\nContributing to open source: my personal project nbmodular, exercism, clojure data science community, and others.\nDo clojure pipeline ala dsblocks.\nReach out to people that are influencing me and ask them questions that may be of interest to others as well, e.g., in twitter, youtube, etc. Examples: David Sinclair, Andrew Huberman, and Peter Attia.\n\nHuberman: difficult task after tenacy task. Did they try to wait until drive/motivation/dopamine comes back to baseline (from the experimented valley)? Are the results as strong in that case? Idea basically is to separate the experiments for long time.\nSinclair: some of the suggested strategies require a lot of will power and tenacity. Do you know of mental strategies that can help us achieve those goals? Tricks such as drinking tea or coffee can be quite effective, but I wonder about strategies focused on dieting, which involve a large amount of tenacity.\nFast.ai: nbdev_export done, link to test tutorials, include examples / demos.\nFinish tenacity podcast and maybe re-listen Paul Conti podcasts book\nFor each X personal things, do one thing that may help (even just a bit) to the community. - Can be for my son - for others Try to find best strategy here, something that makes me feel good and works.\nPotential next project.\n\nLearn R language.\nApplied Statistics for Data Science: null hypothesis tests, etc.\nVisualization techniques and libraries: blogs, kaggle notebooks, other material.\n\nReveal.js / quarto notebooks.\n\nPapers discussed by Huberman, Attia and maybe Sinclair: analyze them from an statistics point of view and write a blog summarizing the findings. Have a list of blogs about this subject.\n\nPotential pitfalls, which ones are stronger from a statistics viewpoint.\nDo rating. Can even be a website with ratings / open review about this type of papers, automatic review that includes ChatGPT type of analysis, etc. With the AI piece we may be able to automatically find sources references and more context information (opinions, rebuttals, etc.) for these papers.\n\nFind kaggle projects, mostly focused on medicine, that can be good to participate in.\n\nAlso for Kaggle Days and social interaction.\n\nCommit myself to write a blog or something everytime I learn something, e.g., TIL like Simon Willison - see his github’s TIL"

    "text": "General strategies about tenacity / will power goals:\n\nClearly write goal objectives before trying. Dieting example: always write I will be eating that day,before eating. This is what I can eat today: menu with 2000 calories for example, 30% fat, 25% protein, 10% sugar.\n\nWrite down times: time when I start breakfast, and duration (end time). Time when I start lunch (if I do it), and duration (end time). Total eating window time (end lunch - beginning breakfast). It should always be lower than 8 hours. No snacks in between.\nWrite down all the coffees and teas, and their times.\nExtra: may be also the regular drinks (e.g., water), to see how this affects sleep.\nAt least something at coarse level, that has just a reasonable accuracy.\n\nDieting or other goals: Always write down what I have eaten (or whatever the goal was). That’s even more important than meeting objectives. I need to know, if I don’t meet them, why I haven’t and what could’ve done better or changed for meeting them. Write this down as well, every time.\n\nAbout writing down what I eat, it doesn’t need to be super-accurate. But at least something at coarse level, that has just a reasonable accuracy.\n\nSleep objectives. If I don’t meet them, what should I’ve done better, what subset of objectives (e.g., number of coffees) I didn’t meet and which strategies I could’ve followed to meet them. Always have empathy and kindness towards myself, not be harsh, but do not stop trying.\nBuy all the necessary wearables: sleep, glucose, lactose and maybe heart rate (because of its relantionship with will power).\nContinue reading, for instance papers about super-agers and how they get will power. Write down a blog summarizing my findings.\nIzan:\n\nwrite down notes from Anita and publish them.\nlook for strategies on savings, and publish them."
