The objective of this post is to try to clarify myself about best practices and software methodology to be followed at different stages of a Data Science project. My process and opinions on this matter are gradually changing over time and I would like to connect with other data scientists to discuss about those, since this is an area that has always be interested for me. This is a work-in-progress post and contains just a set of random thoughts and pointers at the moment.
