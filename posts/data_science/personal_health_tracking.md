# Personal project on health tracking

- **Track Oura features:**
  - All the features of the Oura application

- **Track nutrition features** 
  For example:
    - calories, 
    - macronutrients, 
    - things I suspect might influence, like mushrooms, the things I eat in large quantities: mushrooms, lettuce, cucumbers, 
    - total number of vegetables (portions listed by NutraCheck)
    - maximum quantity of any ingredient, because that way I can check if I’m eating too much of a single ingredient
    - other things like the ones above. 

- **Track bloating**
  If I could track the bloating I have, I’d check it. Afterward, bloating would be 

- **Track water / urination / bloating**
  - Water in-take
  - Number of times I urinate.
  - Approx. number of times I pass gas (if that could be easily tracked by an app), or overall bloating feeling.

- EasyTracker: 
    - when I start working, 
    - how many hours I’ve worked that day, 
    - when I finish working

- **Track physical activity:**
  - Write down what was done each day.
  - Consider categorical variables:
    - Whether it was Pilates or running.
    - What type of Pilates.
    - Number of exercises.
    - Whether weights were used, and if so, how much weight.
    - Number of breaks taken.
    - Average frequency of exercises.
  - Track if:
    - I went out in the morning to look at the sun.
    - I went out to walk, and in general if I went out at some point during the day.

- **Track coffee intake:**
  - Check if this can be done using the app I currently have.
  - If not possible, find another app that allows this tracking.
  - Consider learning to program an app easily (e.g., using ChatGPT or another tool).

- **Track other categorical activities:**
  - Whether I worked on my Open Source project.
  - Whether I talked to someone that day.
  - Whether I dealt with any issues of concern.
  - Track emotional state, including:
    - Frustrations or conflicts with my partner.

- **Monitor screen time:**
  - Track the difference between:
    - The last moment I looked at a screen.
    - When I started sleeping.

- **Track sleep patterns:**
  - Count how many times I woke up during the night.
  - Include this as part of the water and urination tracking.
    - Note when I went to the bathroom during the day.
  - Track activities before sleep:
    - Whether I read before bed.
    - Whether I went straight to bed.

- **Consider the project as a research project:**
  - Focus on the accuracy of:
    - Sleep score.
    - Categorical aspects like REM sleep and deep sleep.
  - Check if the "ring" or other devices can detect if I am sleeping deeply or not.
  - Investigate whether the score from the Aura app provides more detailed data than just a single score.

- **Track weight and related data:**
  - Monitor weight as both a predictor and an independent variable.
  - Track other factors:
    - Amount of fat.
    - Amount of muscle.
  - First, predict with current data to determine accuracy.
  - Then, assess accuracy over time:
    - With one month of data.
    - With two months of data.
    - With one year of data.
    - Track how accuracy improves as more data is added (more variables over time).

- **Analyze data visualizations:**
  - Look at the visualizations currently available.
  - Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  - Assess what insights EDA provides.
  - Determine if the insights help improve understanding or accuracy.

- **Evaluate the impact of classifiers:**
  - Investigate the importance of different classifiers for the application or problem at hand.
  - Perform statistical analysis of the results.
  - Conduct error analysis.

- **Document the research:**
  - Use platforms like Kaggle and GitHub.
  - Explain findings and progress through a blog format.
