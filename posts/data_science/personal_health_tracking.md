# Personal project on health tracking

- All the features of the Oura application

- If possible, NutraCheck, NutraCheck. 
  - If not, I’ll have to get an app that allows me to track food and download it to see how it can be done easily. 
  - For example:
      - calories, 
      - macronutrients, 
      - things I suspect might influence, like mushrooms, the things I eat in large quantities: mushrooms, lettuce, cucumbers, 
      - total number of vegetables (portions listed by NutraCheck)
      - maximum quantity of any ingredient, because that way I can check if I’m eating too much of a single ingredient
      - other things like the ones above. 

- If I could track the bloating I have, I’d check it. Afterward, bloating would be the number of times I pass gas, or if that could be easily tracked by an app. 

- Water intake 

- Number of times I urinate. 

- EasyTracker: 
    - when I start working, 
    - how many hours I’ve worked that day, 
    - when I finish working

- Physical activity.
