Dieting example: always write I will be eating that day,before eating. This is what I can eat today: menu with 2000 calories for example, 30% fat, 25% protein, 10% sugar.\n\nWrite down times: time when I start breakfast, and duration (end time). Time when I start lunch (if I do it), and duration (end time). Total eating window time (end lunch - beginning breakfast). It should always be lower than 8 hours. No snacks in between.\nWrite down all the coffees and teas, and their times.\nExtra: may be also the regular drinks (e.g., water), to see how this affects sleep.\nAt least something at coarse level, that has just a reasonable accuracy.\n\nDieting or other goals: Always write down what I have eaten (or whatever the goal was). That’s even more important than meeting objectives. I need to know, if I don’t meet them, why I haven’t and what could’ve done better or changed for meeting them. Write this down as well, every time.\n\nAbout writing down what I eat, it doesn’t need to be super-accurate. But at least something at coarse level, that has just a reasonable accuracy.\n\nSleep objectives. If I don’t meet them, what should I’ve done better, what subset of objectives (e.g., number of coffees) I didn’t meet and which strategies I could’ve followed to meet them. Always have empathy and kindness towards myself, not be harsh, but do not stop trying.\nBuy all the necessary wearables: sleep, glucose, lactose and maybe heart rate (because of its relantionship with will power).\nContinue reading, for instance papers about super-agers and how they get will power. Write down a blog summarizing my findings.\nIzan:\n\nwrite down notes from Anita and publish them.\nlook for strategies on savings, and publish them."

    "text": "I recently joined the amazing exercism community. Exercism is an online free coding platform that encourages learning programming languages through practice, free mentorship by volunteers, and exposure to similar solutions once our own solution has been submitted and pass the tests. Each exercise comes with associated learning material, which is a concise description of the concepts that are strictly required for attempting the exercise. However, the focus is always to encourage the students through problem solving and autonomously investigating the bits that are required. This follows closely recent research on education and neuro-science.\nI would like to share related thoughts on learning through practice, visual learning, and mathematics or related disciplines. The following are just short notes on this matter, that can serve both as a high-level roadmap to a potential long-term project, and contain some references that I would like to keep in mind and expand in the future.\nI found exercism to be a nicely designed platform that, being open source, could be extended to be applied to other domains beyond programming languages, and in particular to math problems. We could then use libraries to describe the problems visually, similar to what 3blue1brown does. By presenting math problems as both visual puzzles, and in its original text form, we can make the problem more appealing, following the the ideas of Jo Boaler, e.g., in Mathematical mindsets, and visual mathematics. It would be nice if the student could manipulate the problem visually (i.e., manipulating and transforming the graphical elements with a mouse), and if the problem could be presented not only in 2D but also in 3D (using Virtual Reality, ideally), so that the student is able to also manipulate the objects in a sort-of “physical” world (be it through a game that emulates this world, or through gadgets like glasses and gloves, to have a better sensorial experience, although this would only be accessible by people able to buy those gadgets, unfortunately).\nMichael Nielsen has written very nice essays on these lines, under the title “Tools for Thought”. In particular, his essays Toward an exploratory medium for mathematics, Thought as a Technology, and How can we develop transformative tools for thought? and Reinventing Explanation. Similar ideas are recently being developed by many scientists and educators and put in practice in journals such as Distill. I will be including those references in here as I find them, with a brief description, to serve as sources for the future."

Despite the title of the essay, the ideas inside are very much generic for learning to learn basically anything. I will be adding a slighly new perspective which incorporates what I call as a “project-based” approach to learning. This idea is not novel, and can be applied either in conjunction or as an alternative to the ideas expressed in post by D. Higginbotham, depending on what our final goals are. I will also use ideas such as Exploration vs Exploitation from the field of Reinforcement Learning, which I will be explaning for anyone not familiar in this field.\nThe gist of project-based learning is to focus our learning journey on those things that will prove to be important in our daily practice or life in general. It is motivated in part by the fact that, many times, when we learn a new field, e.g., in college, we study many concepts that we will never be using or needing in anyway, and end up completely forgotten. To be more concrete, let us take the field of mathematics as an example.\nGiven the vast amount of things that are actually interesting and relevant for our lives, this approach can be considered sub-optimal in many cases, making us waste a lot of time on topics that are not even connected to those parts that are relevant to us. Having said that, as I explore in this post, it all depends on what the final goal in our learning adventure. For this, I will be using a framework based on the Exploration vs Exploitation trade-off from Reinforcement Learning.\nThe gist of it is that, many times, when we start a learning"

For instance, if we see that the child might do something wrong, instead of waiting and checking if they actually end up doing it, we might avoid it altogether.\nAvoid non-positive attention-seeking mechanisms. For instance, when asking the child to dress-up, it is important to not ask it repeatedly, or otherwise they might just not do it as a way of obtaining a type of attention that we don’t want to encourage, in which case they might happily ignore our request and expect us to be paying this attention continuously. Instead, a better strategy is to say something like “While you dress up I will be getting ready myself. If you have any difficulties while dressing up, please let me know and I can help you, but I would like to see that you try to do it by yourself first”. It is very important that, even when things are a bit challenging, they are encouraged to try them a few times before seeking help."

    "text": "Q & A\nTo better reflect the parenting sessions, each one of the discussed topics is placed in a separate a sub-section, and within it we write a Q & A expressed as a dialogue between parents and coach. Parent questions or observations are indicated with P while coach responses with C.\n\nHitting\n\nP: My child is hitting me a lot lately. It seems as if he doesn’t control his emotions.\nC: When this happens, the first thing we need to ask is whether something changed at school or in other domain that might have affected him in some way.\nP: He’s not saying anything, nor his teachers. We are concerned that we wouldn’t notice if something happened at school. One reason for that concern is that all the staff has recently changed and the new staff is not communicating so much.\nC: If he had a behaviour issue, your teachers would certainly tell you. (Then I remember that one teacher told me about one event when our son pushed another kid). I wouldn’t worry about that.\nC: Regarding your initial question, you need to set your boundaries early in the day. Something like “I’m not going to allow you to hit me anymore”. Say it in an “I love you” manner. Use the last example when that happened. We tell him that this is ok because it happened yesterday (for example), so he feels safe when we talk about this. Then we can say something like “I don’t want that because it hurts me.”\n\nThen, if we see the child is going to hit us, we need to stop him/her before that happens (note for self: this falls under the “prevention is better than cure” general guideline, mentioned above). While we stop him, we can say something like - “Hang on, remember we spoke about this early today? I’m not going to allow you to hit me.”\nIf the child stops trying to hit, then we can the following type of dialogue (just an example situation) with our child:\n- What is it that you need?\n- I want to have yoghurt!\n- Hang on, I see. Let's talk about that without hitting. When was the last time you had one?\n- I had it this morning.\n- That's great, you can have it tomorrow morning.\nThis type of dialogue makes the child learn to rationalize cause and effect.\nThe previous dialogue can happen if the child stops to trying to hit. However, they don’t stop, it is better that we leave the room so that they don’t get the opportunity to do it. We say that we are going to leave because we don’t want to allow them to hit us. By doing so we are not allowing the negativity of the behaviour to last for long time.\n\n\nChild talking bad about school\nP: Our son always talks in a negative way about school.\nC: First of all, we have to be careful that there’s nothing concerning at school. Tell the teachers about his feeling and see what they say about this. After that, we also need to be careful to not be continuously asking our child whether or not he had a good day or, more specifically, if there was any issue at school that day. Especially, we need to avoid asking about in a way that provides an image of us being concerned. This might make our child feel uncomfortable, like investigated, and this doesn’t help them having an honest and open communication.\nInstead of that we could simply ask something general like “how was your day” and, after they respond, we can say something like “Let me tell you how was my day” so that they don’t feel the conversation is just about them or about investigating if there was any issue that day.\nRather than investigating on potential negative things, it’s better to talk about positive things. We can ask what activities he had or what games he played and then ask specific details about those (“What was this painting about?” “Do you remember what colors did you use?” or “What animals there were in that jig-saw?” This helps them practice and strengthen their memory, something especially important at early ages."

    "text": "Short notes / lessons learned\n\nExperts differ on whether Tenacity & Will Power are constant and limited in the individual. I interpret this as whether or not an individual is able to increase their maximum capacity of tenacity & will-power. If the answer is no, this means that each person can only have X amount of tenacity & will power, and nothing they do can increase this amount. That is not the same as saying that our tenacity & will power is constant and cannot change. It can increase throghout life through practice, but it cannot exceed a certain limit, which is fixed. It is this limit or upper bound what is fixed and cannot change.\nOn the previous topic, Dr. Huberman tends to lean towards the camp that, indeed, the maximum achievable Tenacity & Will Power is constant and cannot change.\nOne way of increasing Tenacity & Will Power is through exercise / practice. This means, in a nutshell, to do tasks that one doesn’t want to do, or, conversely don’t engage in activities or behaviours that one would like to engage in, and that are presumably unhealthy or not recommendable in some sense. Huberman informally refers to these tasks as micro-sucks, i.e., things that one doesn’t really feel like doing at some point, but that they are safe and, I interpret, not extremely challenging.\nBiological remarks:\n\nIncreasing testosterone seems to be related with increasing Tenacity & Will Power.\nThere is a specific region of the brain that is strongly associated with Tenacity & Will Power. The bigger this region grows, the more Tenacity & Will Power one has. So-called super-agers (or centenarians, as Dr. Attia calls them) tend to have such regions much bigger than the rest of people. And they tend to engage in activities that they would normally don’t feel like engaging in (at least at the beginning, e.g., things out of their comfort-zone and that they do not feel particularly inclined to do), and avoid unheatlhy or not-recommendable things that they normally desire. Another way of looking at this is that elderly people (in their 60s to 90s) that do not cease trying to improve, evolve, and explore unchartered and mildly not-attractive territories, show in some sense a strong desire of living longer while growing personally, and this usually translates into them living longer. It looks to me, to some extent, as a sort-of self-fulfilling wish."

    "text": "I would like to start contributing following the framework from Dr. Paul Conti. The basic idea is to do things that make me feel good and can help other people at the same time. This can be small things as:\n\nCommenting on interesting reads.\nContributing to open source: my personal project nbmodular, exercism, clojure data science community, and others.\nDo clojure pipeline ala dsblocks.\nReach out to people that are influencing me and ask them questions that may be of interest to others as well, e.g., in twitter, youtube, etc. Examples: David Sinclair, Andrew Huberman, and Peter Attia.\n\nHuberman: difficult task after tenacy task. Did they try to wait until drive/motivation/dopamine comes back to baseline (from the experimented valley)? Are the results as strong in that case? Idea basically is to separate the experiments for long time.\nSinclair: some of the suggested strategies require a lot of will power and tenacity. Do you know of mental strategies that can help us achieve those goals? Tricks such as drinking tea or coffee can be quite effective, but I wonder about strategies focused on dieting, which involve a large amount of tenacity.\nFast.ai: nbdev_export done, link to test tutorials, include examples / demos.\nFinish tenacity podcast and maybe re-listen Paul Conti podcasts book\nFor each X personal things, do one thing that may help (even just a bit) to the community. - Can be for my son - for others Try to find best strategy here, something that makes me feel good and works.\nPotential next project.\n\nLearn R language.\nApplied Statistics for Data Science: null hypothesis tests, etc.\nVisualization techniques and libraries: blogs, kaggle notebooks, other material.\n\nReveal.js / quarto notebooks.\n\nPapers discussed by Huberman, Attia and maybe Sinclair: analyze them from an statistics point of view and write a blog summarizing the findings. Have a list of blogs about this subject.\n\nPotential pitfalls, which ones are stronger from a statistics viewpoint.\nDo rating. Can even be a website with ratings / open review about this type of papers, automatic review that includes ChatGPT type of analysis, etc. With the AI piece we may be able to automatically find sources references and more context information (opinions, rebuttals, etc.) for these papers.\n\nFind kaggle projects, mostly focused on medicine, that can be good to participate in.\n\nAlso for Kaggle Days and social interaction.\n\nCommit myself to write a blog or something everytime I learn something, e.g., TIL like Simon Willison - see his github’s TIL"
