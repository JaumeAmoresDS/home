## Bio
Hello, and welcome to my home page! I work currently as a Principal Data Scientist in Johnson Controls. 
I have been working on Data Science for more than 20 years, in both academia and industry. 
I received a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computer vision in 2006, and have been in industry for more 
than 10 years, working both as individual contributor and technical lead in multi-disciplinary teams. 
I enjoy both the theoretical and practical aspects of Data Science, I like developing high quality software 
based on best practices, and have experience generating intellectual property. Please check my open source 
projects in the last section below.

Apart from my work, I am a dad of a little child and I am interested in early childhood education. 
I intend to write about my research on this subject in my blog posts.

## Education

- Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computer Vision | Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona | 2006 
- M.Sc. in Machine Learning and Computer Vision | Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona | 2003
- B.Sc. in Computer Science | Universitat de Valencia | 2000

## Open Source

At the moment I only have published one open source library written in python with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). 
I intend to publish more projects in the future.

- **forecasting**: [link](https://github.com/JaumeAmoresDS/tsforecast). This library intends to provide a uniform API 
around popular time-series forecasting solutions and libraries. At this moment, I have implemented a library 
based on LSTM auto-regressive models, using tensorflow's dataset API. The next steps are to add baselines 
based on Random Forests, XGBoost, and ARIMA; and integrate libraries such as [darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts) and [tsai](https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai). Hopefully also [gluonts](https://ts.gluon.ai/stable/).
