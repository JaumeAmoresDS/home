## Bio
Hello, and welcome to my home page! I currently work as a Principal Data Scientist in Johnson Controls. 
I have been working on Data Science for more than 20 years, in both academia and industry. 
I received a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computer vision in 2006, and have been in industry for more 
than 10 years, working both as individual contributor and technical lead in multi-disciplinary teams. 
I enjoy both the theoretical and practical aspects of Data Science, I like developing high quality software 
based on best practices, and have experience generating intellectual property. 

Apart from my work, I am a dad of a little child and I am interested in early childhood education and health.
I intend to write about those subjects in my blog posts, above.

## Open Source

At the moment I have published one open source library written in python, based on the nbdev+quarto publishing framework. I intend to publish more projects in the future.

- **nbmodular**: [link](https://github.com/JaumeAmoresDS/nbmodular) Convert data science notebooks with poor modularity to fully modular notebooks that are automatically exported as python modules.
